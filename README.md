# Blasphemous More Items
Adds a variety of new and unique items to be found in Cvstodia

<br>

### Shard of an Executioner's Axe (Rosary Bead)
> A small rusted piece of an executioner's axe. Significantly decreases the charge up time of the charged attack.

<br>

### Miniature Bloody Helmet (Rosary Bead)
> This old worn helmet is caked in dried blood and ashes. It feels bizarrely familiar somehow. Increases the benefits of picking up your guilt fragments.

<br>

### Soccoro's Ribbon (Rosary Bead)
> Bloody length of soft cord used to bind the holy Lady Soccoro. It gives off a soothing warmth still. Completely negates the first instance of damage taken but will no longer work until resting at a Prie Dieu.
