ctname: Shard of an Executioner's Axe
ctdesc: A small rusted piece of an executioner's axe. Significantly decreases the charge up time of the charged attack. 
ctlore: The masked and hooded man glowered at the scene before him. “What is the meaning of this Your Eminence?” 
The pompous robed man pointed at a white and brown dog held tightly by a tired aide. “This wretched thing bit me!” he scoffed. “Do your duty execution, off with its head!”
The executioner frowned, and looked at the animal. It looked up at him innocently, by no means a vicious or rabid looking dog. Far kinder than a fat, arrogant bishop. He wondered if the accusation was even true. 
What if the other accusations weren't true?
He heard the Legionaries' grip tighten upon his weapon behind him, a non too subtle warning. 
The executioner raised his axe, the dog whimpered, as if it knew what was happening. The weapon fell in a flash of steel, and chopped deep into the scaffolding. 
“I have taken the lives of countless guilty,” the executioner's voice grated ominously. “I will not take the life of a single innocent. Man, or beast.” The bishop stared at him in shock, and then made a small gesture.
The executioner brought his bloodstained weapon back up, but it was too late. The world flew by him in slow motion. The last thing he saw were the shattered fragments of his axe tumbling past him. They seemed so serene, so beautiful. And the world went black.
